# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-Application
Apply a support vector machine to classify hand-written digits. SVM algorithm implementation provided by e1071 R package.

The digit data set contains two files: both files are text files. Each file contains a matrix with one data point (=vector of length 256) per row. The 256-vector in each row represents a 16Ã—16 image of a handwritten number. The data contains two classes--the digits 5 and 6 so they can be labeled as -1 and +1, respectively.

**Objectives:**

1. Train linear SVM with soft margin. Cross-validate the margin parameter

2. Train a SVM with soft margin andRBF kernel.

3. Compute the misclassification rate for both algorithms on test set.
